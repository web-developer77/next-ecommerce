                    the transportation of the people. The automobile market was
                    led for decades by United States, and they were the
                    frontrunners in the industry. In South Africa the automobile
                    industry is one of the pillars of support for its economy
                    employing directly over 30,000 people in manufacturing and
                    more than 70,000 in component manufacturing. South Africa is
                    a global leader in turbo charged engines and many of the
                    automobile manufacturing giants like BMW, Mercedes, Ford
                    (Including Mazda) have setup manufacturing plants here. Even

                    manufacturers and car spares manufacturers as they hold
                    major share in this industry. Car manufacturers have been
                    the spearhead of the economy in South Africa. The major car
                    names that were produced here and took the world by storm
                    are BMW 3 Series, VW Golf, Toyota Corolla, VW Polo, Toyota
                    Hilux Vigos, VW Jetta and VW Polo Vivo. Besides being an

                    components. Everyone has to drive or use some sort of mode
                    of transportation. Automobile cars are that important to us

                  <h2>Automobile Industry</h2>
                  <p>
                    The term automobile was used first in 1890 when inventors
                    for the first time made the use of horseless carriage for
                    the transportation of the people. The automobile market was
                    led for decades by United States, and they were the
                    frontrunners in the industry. In South Africa the automobile
                    industry is one of the pillars of support for its economy
                    employing directly over 30,000 people in manufacturing and
                    more than 70,000 in component manufacturing. South Africa is
                    a global leader in turbo charged engines and many of the
                    automobile manufacturing giants like BMW, Mercedes, Ford
                    (Including Mazda) have setup manufacturing plants here. Even
                    the leaders in automobile component industry Arvin Exhaust,
                    Bloxwitch, Corning and many more are also present in South
                    Africa. Automobile Industry is generally the term for car
                    manufacturers and car spares manufacturers as they hold
                    major share in this industry. Car manufacturers have been
                    the spearhead of the economy in South Africa. The major car
                    names that were produced here and took the world by storm
                    are BMW 3 Series, VW Golf, Toyota Corolla, VW Polo, Toyota
                    Hilux Vigos, VW Jetta and VW Polo Vivo. Besides being an
                    exporter of manufactured cars, it is also a hub for its
                    components. Everyone has to drive or use some sort of mode
                    of transportation. Automobile cars are that important to us
                    nowadays, that it is a necessity. Whether it is a company
                    car or a personal one, we drive it and thus we need to have
                    a basic understanding about them. So let’s discuss what
                    makes that stylish sedan, feminine hatchback or muscular SUV
                    run.

              <h2>COMPONENTS AND SPARES</h2>
              <p>
                Well the component of a car can be classified in four sections.{' '}
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Exterior or Body Work:</li>
                <h3>
                  This section includes your exterior that people see for design
                  and colour before purchasing the vehicle. It includes the
                  hood, sunroof, mirrors etc. Exterior is the first thing people
                  see so it is the first impression of the car. No matter if
                  your car is a giant in technical specifications but if it
                  doesn’t look good it is not suitable for you. Different types
                  and colours suit different segment of people according to
                  their budget.{' '}
                </h3>
                <li>Interiors:</li>
                <h3>
                  It is the section that decides whether a car is luxury or an
                  economy class. The better price you pay the better interiors
                  you will get. Interiors in car range from vinyl to leather
                  depending upon the segment of car you purchase. Seat covers,
                  head rests, dashboard, etc. You can see the difference in the
                  interiors and its luxury effect when you drive a BMW 3 series
                  and compare it to VW Polo, both are good cars but the
                  interiors define the touch and feel of a truly expensive
                  vehicle.{' '}
                </h3>
                <li>Electronics:</li>
                <h3>
                  All the cars nowadays are hybrids. The era of mechanical cars
                  is over. All cars include electronics for them to function
                  properly and provide a good user response. They include your
                  GPS devices, digital speedometers, cd players, automatic
                  headlamps, etc. Even the ignition locks are embedded with
                  advanced electronics. You can only use your own key to open
                  the car so advanced are the embedded system.{' '}
                </h3>
                <li>Powertrain and Chassis:</li>
                <h3>
                  No matter how much the cars may have changed but the basis of
                  the functioning remains the same. The powertrain includes your
                  engine, gears, steering and the basic mechanical components
                  that are required to make a mobile an automobile. It’s still
                  the same piston and crank that work and the wear and tear is
                  the same as it was 3 decades ago. You still need to maintain
                  the keep this section oiled and greased for smooth
                  performance.{' '}
                </h3>
              </ul>
              <h2>REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE:</h2>
              <p>
                Driving and Repairs go side by side. If you don't maintain your
                vehicle well it may ditch you in the time of need. Although
                basic services are regularly performed by the car companies in
                their service packages and they take care of the major parts of
                the powertrain and electronics under warranty but what about a
                scratch or a dent that neighbour's kid left on your car. This
                small scratches and dents will ruin the perfect look of your
                vehicle and may hinder your self-esteem. You now require a in
                budget paint job so your car feels again like new. This work is
                done by spray painting and body repair shops in your local town
                and the best way to find is ezyfind.co.za.{' '}
              </p>
              <p>
                Those small nicks and scuffs cannot be painted by you. Many
                people think they can match the colour with a spray paint. Many
                newbies buy a spray can and just paint the area of the scruff,
                but you won’t get a good result unless you are willing to spray
                the entire car in the same spray paint. If you need results the
                touch ups need to be done by a professional as they can inject
                the exact same colour in the spray can and can also take care of
                the rust and oxidization. So if you need to have the same look
                of the new car get in touch with ezyfind.za and let them take
                the headache of finding you the quote from all the local
